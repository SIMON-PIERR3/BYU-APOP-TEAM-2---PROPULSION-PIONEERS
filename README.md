This repository contains code for actuating the nozzle designed by BYU-APOP-TEAM-2---PROPULSION-PIONEERS.
Additionally, this repository contains code for some simulations that were critical to design decisions.

Nonideal_Turbojet.m - Full cycle analysis of a JETCAT p100RX with the objective of determining the thrust as a function of the nozzle outlet diameter.

Analytical Thrust Chart.xlsx - Spreadsheet with table and chart of feasible and infeasible thrusts given nozzle outlet diameter.

LabVIEW_Load_Cell_Function.Vi - Allows thrust measurements of the Jetcat p100rx when the load cells are connected to a computer.
